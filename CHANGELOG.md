## 0.9.1 (2024-09-08)

---

- Fixed CI.yml to work around the bug in GitHub Actions where matrix jobs don't have any status of the sub jobs. See [#41](https://github.com/John-Robbins/tbp/issues/41).
- Added the [GitHub and GitHub Actions](https://john-robbins.github.io/tbp/project-notes#github-and-github-actions) section to the documentation.
- Added the pyreadline3 dependency to the [documentation](https://john-robbins.github.io/tbp/project-notes#small-python-friction-points).
- Updated the README and [Getting Started Installation](https://john-robbins.github.io/tbp/getting-started#installation) section to point to the Latest releases.
- This is basically a practice release to ensure I have the steps down. :crossed_fingers: (Thanks for your patience!)
