# What you are about to see in this file is a crime against Python, testing,
# and all programming best practices. Heed my advice! Don't do this at home. ðŸ˜¹
#
# When developing the CTRL+C and CTRL+D (CTRL+Z, ENTER on Windows) handling for
# tbp, I needed a way to do those keystrokes as they would occur with the
# Python built in input function. Traversing windswept mountain ranges of basic
# testing content and wading through the ancient swamps of outdated forum
# posts, I've found nothing that talks about how to test your app with those
# keystrokes under pytest.
#
# In tbp, there's hundreds of tests that use the very cool Monkey Patching to
# replace the built in Python input function. However, those tests, and any
# discussion of testing the input function, assume you're pumping in nice and
# normal text and not any interesting keystrokes. After much trial and error,
# I found a way to "pretend" CTRL+C and CTRL+D occur so my testing covers those
# cases.
#
# The key (HAH!) to CTRL+C and CTRL+D is that they generate exceptions,
# KeyboardInterrupt and EOFError, respectively. The question is how to get
# those generated in the proper context of the input function while testing.
# With the traditional Monkey Patching, you provide an iterator that loops
# through an array of text, which returns each line as though the user entered
# it in the input function.
#
# My idea was to build a generator, fake_input below, that takes a list of
# those strings, and when it sees special characters, it would raise the
# exception, just like occurs when using the input function. Turns out, that
# works! However, and this is super important, you must be sure your code
# handles the exception you raised and does not let it propagate out of your
# code. Also, because the generator called by pytest can get in a weird state
# when raising a KeyboardInterrupt for CTRL+C, always pass a default value to
# next. In my case, I use the tbp command language %q to quit.
#
# Like all hacks, I have no idea if this will keep working in the future.
#
# ELIT CAVE! - Developer beware!
